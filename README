This project's pupose is to test the capability of CUDA-aware MPI

There are two versions of the program: with CUDA-aware support from MPI lib and without it.

In the CUDA-aware version, the MPI lib must support CUDA-aware MPI:

	MVAPICH2 1.8/1.9b
	OpenMPI 1.7 (beta)
	CRAY MPI (MPT 5.6.2)
	IBM Platform MPI (8.3)

Heat-distribution model demonstrate the environment by matrix of cells, each cell has it own temperature. Within every loop of the model, each cell will compute its new temperature by the average value of its heat and the heat of 8 (Moor neighborhood) cells around it.

The program's still lack of comment to describe more detail about the code. I will improve the readability of it later.
